Hello! I'm Saif, from Dhaka, Bangladesh.

I possess entrepreneurial skills, critical thinking abilities, and a design-thinking mindset that enable me to excel in the research and development of IoT-related products. I am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest developments in design and AI, and always seeking new challenges to expand my skills and knowledge

I am working as mechanical Design Engineer at [BJIT Group](https://bjitgroup.com/)

I am a Solidworks Champions at [Dassault Systems](https://www.credly.com/badges/2751371b-614a-4711-b94e-d17018d964bd/public_url) that program was designed to recognize the most passionate SolidWorks users around the world

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
